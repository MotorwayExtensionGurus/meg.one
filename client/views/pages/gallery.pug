					p This was the server's and group's first completed diagonal highway which was dug from spawn to the -X, -Z world border. This dig was completed by Citadel2222, Illville502, VeryVon, DantezWrath, KevinKC2014, and Superbad0315.

					p Our second elytra-friendly diagonal highway from SPAWN to WB (+X, +Z) was completed on the 4th of September, 2020. Similar to the -X, -Z highway, it took us 3,000 hours to dig. This marks a total of 6,000 hours of digging clocked in by the Motorway Extension Gurus. It should be noted that this number does not factor in the many many more hours spent organizing the logistics of this project by all involved.
					p It is with this dedication that a select handful of individuals on 2B2T are undertaking public infrastructure projects that are unlikely to have ever been initiated - and if begun, ever completed. For this reason, the individuals who have contributed to this project need be recognized.
					p This digging project was initiated on the 28th of May, 2020 by #[strong @harritaco], #[strong @KevinKC2014], and #[strong @Mr. Potato]. This was no small feat; over three months, these individuals extended the 3 * 3 tunnel by approximately 37.5K nether (300K overworld equivalent), per day, for 100 consecutive days. Sizeable contributions were also made by #[strong @Max/5K5K], #[strong Paragon], and #[strong @Squirlboy006] during the mid-late stages of the dig, for which the team is grateful.

					p The +X highway has been widened from 1 block wide, 2 blocks high to 3 blocks wide, 3 blocks high.
					p This project was undertaken by #[strong @Justen], who virtually single-handedly completed this project over a two-month period (20th of July, 2020 - 25th of September, 2020). The total time taken to complete this dig was approximately 1,500 hours, which equates to 62 days of continuous mining (~60.5K nether/day or ~484K overworld/day).

					p Our third diagonal highway from SPAWN to WB (+X, -Z) was completed on the 14th of October, 2020. Equal with the other two completed diagonals highways (-X, -Z and +X, +Z), this project required approximately 3,000 hours. This amounts to a total of 10,500 hours digging clocked in by the Motorway Extension Gurus.
					p This dig was initiated on the 7th of June, 2020 by #[strong illville502], #[strong Citadel2222] and #[strong tycrek]. This was another huge dig, and we are glad to have ticked another diagonal off the list - now all that is left is the -X, +Z diagonal ðŸ”¥.
